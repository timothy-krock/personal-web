    <h1>The Question Game</h1>
    <h2>
      <small>
          This webpage exists because I'm really bad about running out of things to talk about. A while ago, I started looking for fun quesitons to ask people in conversation, other than "How 'bout that weather?". A lot of the questions come from askreddit, some I just made up, and some are just classics.
        <br>
          The fruit question is my go-to in when I'm sitting around people looking for something to talk about. A lot of heated debates come about as a result, and they're all hilarious.
        <br>
          I came across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html?_r=1">this article</a> about while I was putting together this list. It offers that going through their list of questions can give you an intimate glimpse into the mind of the person you're talking with.
